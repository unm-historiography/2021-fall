## My thoughts on Historiography

I’ll begin by saying that this has been among the more thought-provoking courses I’ve taken while at UNM. For me, this class was a peak behind the curtain of history, learning not just how history is written but also discussing its purpose. I was pleasantly surprised at how a class ostensibly centered only around history involved a debate about much broader concepts, like language, culture, politics, and even truth itself. __If this class has taught me anything, it’s that history truly is a varied field, not just in terms of its content, but in the many factors that influence how it is written.__

I thought the structure of the class worked well overall, though it did seem somewhat slow during the Fulbrook readings. I particularly liked the first part of the class, which seemed to act as a chronological exploration of Western historiography. While my background knowledge of world history gave me some sense of what differentiated the Medieval Period from the Renaissance from the Enlightenment and so on, I hadn’t ever considered how historical writings changed between these periods. __After having read Fulbrook, I now see why the phrase “paradigm shift” is so important to understanding historiographical development across time.__ I particularly liked Week 5-7, in which the class got to discuss some of the postmodern challenges to history, most of which I was very amicable to. One concept I think deserved a bit more attention during this section was that of Archival Power and Archival Silence. While it didn’t sound especially interesting at first, I found it the process by which archives shape history really fascinating. When first looking at the schedule, I was worried that the course would deal too much in abstraction, but I think discussions of things like Archival Power help to ground the study of historiography in the material world. 

I was less thrilled with the second part of the class, which dealt primarily with the Fulbrook readings, but I believe that has more to do with (what I found to be) Fulbrook’s enigmatic writing style than the structure of the course. Fulbrook has a tendency of describing other historian’s positions for a few pages before circling back to her commentary on those positions, which can make reading her work a challenge (though in fairness the book is written for professional historians). It was during the Fulbrook portion of the class that I think the seminar style discussions were most beneficial, as we all collectively tried to uncover the exact arguments Fulbrook was putting forth in each chapter. __In the end, I think learning about paradigms in historical writing and hearing Fulbrook’s “so what?” rebuke of postmodernist criticisms was worth studying in spite of the challenging read.__

I’d also like to share some thoughts about the digital history aspect of this course. Admittedly, I was not a fan at the start. While I really liked the look and accessibility of the Metahistory site, everything else – markdown, Dillinger, and Github – just seemed to add another layer of complexity to submitting assignments. However, as time went on and I got used to how Github functions, I came to enjoy seeing how little bits of code like an underscore could change how my posts looked. I’m finding that our final project is especially satisfying to put together as the end product seems genuinely unique. __Initially I wished that we could just submit a regular paper, printed out in 12-point font and all that, but after seeing how I can contribute to an open-source history site that not only offers interesting content but is also visually engaging, I’m happy to have had the chance to learn how to use Github and markdown.__ Additionally, I’ve found Zotero (another digital program I was weary of at first) to be an immensely useful tool for organizing material and it has become a key part of my research process. 

A consistent thread throughout the whole course that I’d like to comment on here is the debate between history being closer to an art or a science, which of course is closely related to the ongoing objectivity debate. I think even before this class, I was very aware of the many ways in which history has been used to propagate false narratives (especially given my dual studies in both history and political science, which has often involved deconstruction of histories wrought with American exceptionalism). I mention that because I don’t think I’ve ever conceptualized history as a pure science, dedicated to reflecting the past. Instead, I think __historians use available sources (already limited by archival power) to interpret the past and paint a picture. As such, historians can only offer a variation of the past, limited by paradigms under which they’re working. Even so, I agree with Fulbrook that not all interpretations of history are equally valid, and that we can gain a better understanding of the past through conversing with those who work within different paradigms.__ While I can see how this process is vaguely similar to science insofar as it involves members of the same field working together to analyze, debunk, or reinforce existing understandings, I still believe that history is closer to an art. 

Undeniably, historians ought to lean into the scientific aspects of their craft – using evidence, being transparent, adhering to certain writing standards, etc. However, no amount of rigorous study removes the historian’s own interpretation, as evidenced by the dueling interpretations (perhaps just as if not more rigorously studied) offered by their colleagues studying the same phenomena. As I see it, scientists work toward a universal truth of the world and its physical nature, but no such goal exists for those in the humanities. Every work of history involves some amount of interpretation and storytelling. Even firsthand accounts of a particular event will differ based on who is giving the account and their relation to the subject matter. __Objectivity is a noble aim, but an ultimately unattainable one. It is the artistic elements of history that imbues it with life__ - the fact that historians can craft stories, make arguments, debate and discuss the same material - that’s what this field is all about. _More than anything else, history is a conversation._
