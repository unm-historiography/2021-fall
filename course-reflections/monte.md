I wasn’t sure what to expect when I first stepped into the class. I knew that from what my wife had told me, that it would be difficult. So I believe part of me was prepared for what that might look like. When the class began I felt like I had an understanding on the topics, or at least a basis for what was being asked.

As the semester carried on and we began to explore topics, the pattern was similar to a traditional history class and I think that I could grasp the information. We talked about a staircase that moved through history from one point to the next and I think that is a good representation. Digging into how each civilization or time period viewed and recorded history.

Once we left that traditional history class behind I was back and forth. I mean this as in some days I would read a topic over and over and barely have an understanding of it. Some topics I could grasp and take parts with me. In class it seemed like we all came to different conclusions and at first I felt maybe I wasn’t grasping the message.

Once I started digging in and reading over reflections. Not just mine but other people It became clear. In full honesty the clouds didn’t part and I understood all the content of the class but I realized something. In my other history classes I was asking things I have never asked before. 

Who wrote those and for who?
Who isn’t mentioned in this source?
What was the intention of this group of people, what lense are they using?

I can’t say I’m ready to write a book on historiography, I can’t even say I could sit down and fully articulate everything this course has challenged me to think about. I can say that it’s made me ask questions and look at material that I once looked at as “that’s a primary source” and start looking at it seven different ways.

I can also honestly say this course frustrated me at times, opened my eyes at others but it also made me sit and wonder “what is history, and why do we study it?” What frustrates me the most is I could give my opinion on the topic and I’m not even sure it’s right because then I think about my own personal bias that I have without even realizing. Who is my history for?

An apt example was as I did my project on Scottish enlightenment I read as conflict between some of the founding fathers and members of the period, namely Hume. Hume was criticized for his historical writing. Normally I would note that it got backlash and move along. However I started asking myself. What was Thomas Jefferson’s intention for criticizing Hume? How does he view history? How does the life experience of where they came from change the attitude for say the writing of English history? How reliable are the sources? What do they have to gain? 

I’m taking two skills from this class that I hadn’t put enough thought into prior. Firstly I will try to critically examine not only information given to me from others but also information that I put out. Not just historically recording but all information, I think, well I hope it has made me a bit more self reflective.

The other isn’t as profound but I really enjoyed using markdown. I’m terrible with computers and any skill is a wonderful addition to my limited skillset. I enjoyed this class. I really did, some of the ideas I better understood in this class will hopefully carry over and help me better analyze my sources and keep asking why?

Full disclosure: I don't think I will ever read Fulbrook again. (Well never say never.) Though I must admit it changed my perspective and sort of pushed me to push back further on sources I’d always assumed were almost gospel. Question everything, and I liked the way she presented information. Even though she clearly sided one way, she presented information about both sides for nearly every topic. I want to strive to be more impartial in my analysis.

Archives and silent voices. I can honestly say that is something I can’t get out of my head. I’ve never thought about the background. Who puts an archive together? Who gets left out? Which only takes you further down the rabbit hole of who gets left out of history? Can history be unbiased? Even though I don’t think it can, doesn’t mean we shouldn’t strive to give the most accurate picture we can. I love the idea of historian detectives we all talked about. Just putting together clues trying to put out the information best we can.

I started this class getting our first author’s name wrong. If anything else I learned to double check names. All joking aside, this was a class I didn’t expect to…well I didn’t know what to expect. However I can say I will take skills and information away from it. What really helped was reinforcing that we may not understand everything, that really helped me alot.
