###Final Reflection 

 

Before I go into the historiographical aspects of this class, I do admit a certain level of respect for markdown. Towards the beginning of the class, I definitely only saw it as a weird, extra step now being required for turning in work. Although its only a light understanding of the website code it does feel good simply knowing how to do things like make a heading bold. (That’s why I made sure to put it in) 

 

By far my favorite concept we’ve covered was the discussion on structuralism vs more individualist history. Like many things in this class we walk the edge between philosophy and history. I’ve always wondered to what degree society has made me and in turn to what degree will I make society. Unfortunately, like many things in this class, there is no real answer to this question; but that does of course allow us to move back and forth between the two as we please.  

 

I also kinda enjoyed the way this class became more and more abstract as time went on. It was some point around early November that I was doing a reading. I remember getting to the very end of a section and then realizing I had absolutely no idea what I had even just read. I believe it was somewhere around the third quarter of the book. I can easily say that this book was the most painful part of the class. 

 

The public history section was extremely effective as well. I think for the most part the largest goal of public history is to make the past more accessible for everyone to understand. In the same way Bill Nye the Science Guy makes science more accessible things such as the history channel work to bring the past into the present. Additionally, another goal of it is to make history far more universal. Of course, the largest criticism of the universal history objective is simply that more often than not histories from different cultures are at odds with each other. There’s always a colonized history and a colonizer history. I truly believe the only way to make a universal history is to simply compile all available knowledge and preserve it.  

 

A concept that sort of made me loose all sense of reality was the archival history section. In the past I hadn’t considered the fact that if you wanted to get rid of a culture you could easily just not preserve their artifacts or history. Hoarding doesn’t seem quite as bad when viewing history from this angle. With those who choose what goes into the archives standing as arbiters of reality, putting them in check and making archives far more public and permanent seems like an extremely necessary thing. 

 

One thing that in a way made me feel slightly sad or guilty is the broad concept of romantic history. This of course being the concept of deifying our heroes or making society seem like “the good ol’ days.” I think each of us will always have the kid inside us absolutely ecstatic for that one topic that made us really enjoy history. For me it was the Revolutionary War and that famous painting of Washington crossing the Delaware River. I suppose the historiography adult would say something along the lines of “it didn’t really happen that way.” Of course their completely right but I think at the end of the day Fullbrook taught us it doesn’t really matter. I guess in some weird inspirational way, historiography taught me how to see these issues with history; but that doesn’t mean it took away the thing that originally made me love history.  

 

I think I’d like to close out this semester with the same question that we started it off with and that is “What is history for?” I think the first half of this class and the reason Fullbrook wrote her book, is that history is for whatever we want to make it for. To some degree when we set out to “do history” we have a goal in mind and more often than not human have a way of finding evidence that supports what we initially set out to prove. I guess in that way history can be weaponized for our own purposes. This of course is always a posibilty but as Fullbrook would put it, “who cares.” 

 

Over the course of this class I think we’ve had a lot of thought-provoking discussion and had an incredible time learning new ways of seeing history. By far it was my favorite history class and I feel as though I have learned far more than any other class. The reason for this is that other classes focus on a concept or time period but this one forces and understanding of all history; requiring extreme reflection and dabbling in human psychology and philosophy.
