I leave this class with a completely different outlook on History than I had walking in. I had looked at history as a set of undisputed facts and events that brought humanity to this point and time. I thought becoming a history major would allow me to understand how culture formed the world we live in today. 

I am now more aware of the abstract nature of history. The ways in which the past in not history, that was a big one. History is what people like us, historians, and students of history, shine a light on. History is also a collection of perspectives that can be argued. Truth is more elusive than first thought. One event does not override or erase another, but each could be used together to gain better understanding. Also, in postmodern thought, each could be invalidated. 

Some of the philosophies of history that we looked at were light bulb moments for me. Things such as circular history for example. Historians once thought we would reach a certain point only to start all over again. While this is not entirely true, it could be true in aspects of society or even someone’s personal life. Thus, we arrive back at perspective.

Postmodern history was completely new to me as a concept. It makes perfect sense, but it also changes, or can change, one’s outlook on history. I went from a belief in events that happened to some hesitation in believing all that was once taught. Perspective gives an event meaning and validation. 

I enjoyed learning about those who helped bring History into a more scientific realm of study. Source material and footnotes being a huge part of the way we write today; it seems impossible to approach this subject without that as a component. People like Rank and Bancroft legitimized the study into something beneficial for the world, not just a past time hobby. 

I was happy to learn about Romantic verse Critical Analysis. So much of the world’s history, and a good deal of American history, has been romanticized. This typically leads to a one-sided story. 

Learning that historians of today shine a lamp on the past, we know that a lot has been left out. More stories can be found, and it is our responsibility to bring an accurate account of that which we find. 

The way history was once told defined cultural norms for decades. We have the ability, and knowledge now to bring greater awareness to a new identity. One that can still be found from learning from the past. 

I also never knew historians could, and would, argue so much. It is a good thing to come to a battle of history well-armed. This class has given me that ability. We can have concrete research, and we know enough to know that we don’t have all the answers. 

We as historians can make the world a better place than it is now by looking more closely at the past and pulling from that a history that is meaningful for us both now and in the future. 

Fulbrook was a complete challenge to me. I hope to return to her in the future. I know I did not fully understand most of what she was saying, but I did learn a valuable lesson from her. To understand and look for bias and perspective. 

One way in which we can shape the future through history is by becoming more prolific with writing and publishing our own research and findings. Which brings me to markdown and the public history website. I feel that Dr. Gibbs would like to yell at me for some of the mistakes I’ve made in that endeavor. For example, I am still struggling to get images onto my essay. However, this tool is an instrument for good, and gives to us the very ability to be what we came here to become. Historians who can, and do, make a difference. 

I take from this class as my biggest lesson the analogy of the tree. From this image we learn, soil is the past and the archivist are the roots. We historians find and tell the stories that make the tree and the branches. The leaves I see as the people who hear and interpret the story. They find meaning that is suitable for them. This meaning is carried with that person into their own perspective and life trials. Later, the farmer in me sees how those leaves will eventually fall back down to the ground and become part of the soil. When that happens, the soil changes. This change in soil was initiated by the historian who saw the need to analyze and tell a story.
